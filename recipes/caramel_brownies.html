    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      This caramel brownies recipe brings the two together for the gooiest,
      fudgiest, and moist treat you won’t be able to get enough of. The caramel
      takes the brownies to a whole new level. This is a decadent dessert that’s
      always a crowd-pleaser. These caramel brownies are so easy to make. You
      don’t need any special equipment. No mixer, no candy thermometer, just a
      whisk, and spatula! Truly, these will be the best thing you’ll ever make.
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Butter: use unsalted butter as there is measured salt added.</li>
      <li>
        Cocoa powder: I like to use unsweetened cocoa powder for this brownie
        batter, but you can use Dutch-processed cocoa powder in a pinch.
      </li>
      <li>
        Sugar: this recipe uses white sugar and brown sugar. White sugar makes
        the brownies chewy, whereas the molasses from the brown sugar makes the
        brownies fudgy.
      </li>
      <li>
        Chocolate chips: adding chocolate chips to the batter leads to your
        brownies having a more intense chocolate flavor and a gooey and melty
        texture. While I use semi-sweet chocolate chips, you can also use dark
        chocolate chips or milk chocolate chips.
      </li>
      <li>
        Sweetened condensed milk: make sure you use sweetened condensed milk to
        make the caramel. Evaporated milk is usually right beside it on the
        shelves at stores, so double-check you’ve grabbed the correct can.
      </li>
      <li>
        Caramel candies: you must use caramel candies for the distinct caramel
        layer in the brownies. Store-bought caramel sauce used as an ice cream
        topping is too thin and will blend into the brownie layer.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the melted butter and cocoa
        powder until well combined.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the sugars, eggs, vanilla, and ½ teaspoon salt and whisk until
        smooth.
      </li>
      <li>
        At the same time, in a small saucepan, heat the condensed milk over
        medium-low heat until warm, about 3 minutes, stirring frequently. Add
        the caramels and remaining ½ teaspoon salt, stirring until fully melted
        and smooth. Remove from the heat.
      </li>
      <li>Stir in the flour and chocolate chips.</li>
      <li>
        Spread half of the batter in an 8×8-inch baking pan and line with
        parchment paper. Pour ⅔ of the caramel sauce over the brownie batter in
        the pan.
      </li>
      <li>
        Dollop the remaining batter on top of the caramel layer. Bake the
        caramel brownies for 35 to 45 minutes. Let cool completely in the pan on
        a wire rack. Drizzle with the remaining caramel sauce and sprinkle with
        salt if desired.
      </li>
    </ol>
