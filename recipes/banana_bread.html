    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      This banana bread recipe creates the most delicious, moist loaf with loads
      of banana flavor. Why compromise the banana flavor? Friends and family
      love my recipe and say it's by far the best! It tastes wonderful toasted.
      The banana bread is moist, delicious, and absolutely packed with banana
      flavor!
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Flour: All-purpose flour gives the banana bread structure.</li>
      <li>
        Baking soda: Baking soda acts as a leavener, which means it helps the
        banana bread rise.
      </li>
      <li>
        Salt: A pinch of salt enhances the overall flavor, but it won't make the
        loaf taste salty.\
      </li>
      <li>
        Butter: A stick of butter lends richness, moisture, and irresistible
        flavor.
      </li>
      <li>
        Brown sugar: Brown sugar sweetens things up and adds a hint of warmth.
      </li>
      <li>
        Eggs: Eggs act as a binding agent, which means they hold the batter
        together.
      </li>
      <li>Bananas: Of course, you'll need bananas! Choose overripe bananas.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Combine the dry ingredients in one bowl.</li>
      <li>
        Beat the butter and sugar in another bowl. Add the eggs and mashed
        bananas.
      </li>
      <li>Add the wet mixture to the dry mixture.</li>
      <li>Stir in the flour and chocolate chips.</li>
      <li>Pour the batter into a loaf pan and bake in a preheated oven.</li>
      <li>
        This banana bread is super moist thanks to butter, eggs, and brown sugar
        (which adds more moisture than white sugar). Plus, mashed bananas have
        plenty of moisture on their own. Make sure you store the banana bread
        properly to keep it moist for several days.
